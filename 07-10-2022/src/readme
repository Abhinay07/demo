Inheritance

Getting all the properties and methods from parent class ( Base class) to child class.


Return types
void -- Return nothing
int - it will return int value
String = it will return string value
Double, float - it will return that dataType

public -- It will accessable everywhere in project.
private -- it will accessable inside the class.
default -- By Default JVM will take default. Accessable within Package.
protected -- It will accessable into other packages.

Encapsulation

It is a mechanism used to hide sensitive data from users.
Variables will be set as private so that it can't be accessed directly.
It can be achieved using setters and getters methods.

MethodOverride - To access a method from a parent(Super) class into child class. Runtime Polymorphism.
MethodOverloading - To use same method in same class with different no. of arguments and different dataType. ComplieTime Polymorphism
