Inheritance

Getting all the properties and methods from parent class ( Base class) to child class.


Return types
void -- Return nothing
int - it will return int value
String = it will return string value
Double, float - it will return that dataType

public -- It will accessable everywhere in project.
private -- it will accessable inside the class.
default -- By Default JVM will take default. Accessable within Package.
protected -- It will accessable into other packages.

Encapsulation

It is a mechanism used to hide sensitive data from users.
Variables will be set as private so that it can't be accessed directly.
It can be achieved using setters and getters methods.

Method Signature
Access Modifier Keyword Return Type Method Name & Parameters
public          static  void        main(String[] args)

Polymorphism
One method can showcase into many forms.

MethodOverride - To access a method from a parent(Super) class into child class. Runtime Polymorphism.
MethodOverloading - To use same method in same class with different no. of arguments and different dataType. ComplieTime Polymorphism

Abstraction -- Hiding Internal details and showing what is required.
Class which extends abstract class must and should implement abstract methods or it will also become abstract class.
Abstract class can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods.
Abstact class can't have objects.
It will implemented by using "extends" keyword.
A class can only extend one another class.

Interface -- 100% Abstract Methods. It will implemented by using "implements" keyword.
A class can implement n number of interfaces.
